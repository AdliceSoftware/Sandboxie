SANDBOXIE INSTALLER INSTRUCTIONS

To create Sbie NSIS installer environment

1) Install NSIS 2.5 (installer is located at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%202/2.50/) Later versions will not work with the Sbie NSI file.
2) You will also need NSIS InetC plugin https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Inetc_plug-in
3) From Inetc.zip, copy \Plugins\x86-ansi\InetC.dll to your NSIS plugins folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Plugins)
4) Overwrite C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\System.nsh with install\nsis_updates.zip\nsis\Contrib\Modern UI\System.nsh
5) Copy language files from install\nsis_updates.zip\nsis\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files to C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Contrib\Modern UI\Language files
6) The install also requires Iconv 1.9.2.1747  (for international language conversion) which can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm
	You need 2 zip files. The “Binaries” and the “Dependencies”. These contain the 3 binaries that are required:
	Iconv.exe
	Libiconv2.dll
	Libintl3.dll
	
	Copy these 3 binaries into a folder under the Sandboxie source tree named "tools\iconv" At the same level as Sandbox.Sln (e.g. C:\src\Sbie\tools\iconv)

Everything above only needs to be done once. Then your machine should be good to go.



To create the Sbie installers

The Sbie installer NSI file is \install\SandboxieVS.nsi

1) Sign the binaries (if applicable).
2) Set the #defines in \common\my_version.h (SBIE_INSTALLER_PATH, etc.) to the location of your binaries. (These #defines are read by SandboxieVS.nsi).
3) Edit \install\SandboxieVS.nsi and uncomment the !define _BUILDARCH for the version you want to create an installer for.
4) In Explorer, right-click on \install\SandboxieVS.nsi, and select "Compile NSIS Script".
	The resulting installer binary (SandboxieInstall64.exe or SandboxieInstall32.exe) will be saved to SBIE_INSTALLER_PATH (from my_version.h).
5) Sign the installers.
6) To create the combined 32/64 bit installer, in Visual Studio, r-click on the "SandboxieInstall" project, click "Project Only" -> "Build Only SandboxieInstall"
	This will create a SandboxieInstall.exe in the install folder
7) Sign the combined installer.
